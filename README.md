# PassiveCalculator
Some python code for a passive agressive calculator that flips out if you put a zero in the denominator.

# Installation
Literally just copy and paste the code into a Python window

# Petie Calc vs. Petie Calc v2
Petie Calc v2 is way better it has the random moduole imported. Petie Calc has one response that doesnt change as compared to the random generated responses.
